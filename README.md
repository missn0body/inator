# inator

Welcome to the Calculator-Inator. An interactive terminal application where you
can evaluate math expressions piecewise. For instance, to evaluate the expression
'1 + 2 + 3' at the prompt, you can type in '1' to load the number one into its
internal buffer, '+ 2' and then '+ 3' to evaluate '1 + 2 + 3'. As of version 1.0.0,
the only operators supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
exponentiation. This program does not have command-line arguments.

This program was particularly inspired by older BASIC interpreters such as GW-BASIC
or Commodore BASIC, as well as line editors such as 'ed' and 'edlin'. This idea might
have been half-baked in hindsight, but I like the enjoyment of making my own tools, plus
I plan to add additional functionality later on.
